**Client-Side Vulnerabilities Collection**

This repository contains my research work on real-world client-side security vulnerabilities, including:

CORS Misconfiguration – Leads to unauthorized data access.

Prototype Pollution – Allows modification of Object.prototype resulting in RCE/DoS.

CSRF to Stored XSS – Lets attackers inject persistent JavaScript via CSRF.
